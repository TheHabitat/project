# The Habitat Project

The Habitat Project aims at developing a proof of concept for a sustainable closed ecosystem able to support human life.

The project will help speed up efforts on water conservation, food production, waste management and clean energy  among other issues that arise from maintaining a closed loop system.

The general idea is to develop and test technologies in out test bed: **[The Box](https://github.com/TheHabitat/project/wiki/The-Box)**

The milestones to be accomplished in every step of the project can be found in **[Milestones](https://github.com/TheHabitat/project/wiki/Milestones)**
