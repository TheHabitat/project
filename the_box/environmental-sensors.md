**[WIP](WIP)**

We need to develop a sensor toolkit to be used in every room of the habitat to monitor air quality. Suggested capabilities are:
* Temperature
* Pressure
* Humidity
* Suspended particles
* Oxigen Concentration
* CO2 Concentration
* CO Concentration
* Methane Concentration
* Long chain Hydrocarbons?

Feel free to open a discussion.
