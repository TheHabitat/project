## The Space

The Box is meant to, in the first 3 iterations, be inhabited by one person. The space distribution targets the maintenance of the space and support systems and the inhabitant during the lockdown period and is comprised of the following rooms:

* **Lab** Where we analise and further improve the delicate chemical and biological balance of the habitat. Equipment is being discussed at #5;
* **Workshop** Where we repair and improve the mechanics and structure of the habitat. Tooling discussed at #6;
* **Greenhouse** Where we grow our food, no discussion so far, feel free to start one.
* **Machine Room** Where we keep the equipment that keeps the system running(Cooling, Life support, etc), no discussion so far, feel free to start one.
* **Living Quarters** Where our inhabitant lives, no discussion so far, feel free to start one.
* **Bathroom** I'll let you guess this one... No discussion so far, feel free to start one.
* **Gym** Staying fit, no discussion so far, feel free to start one.

Total area is yet to be defined based on how the areas are finally equipped.


## Life Support

The life support systems will be improved at each iteration of the experiment and, in the final version, will comprise:
* **[Environmental Sensors](environmental-sensors)**
* **Chemical CO2 Scrubber** The scrubber is being discussed in #4
* **Biological CO2 Scrubber** The bio scrubber is being discussed in #7
* **Humidity Control** No discussion so far, feel free to start one.
* **Temperature Control** Temperature Control is being discussed in #8
* **[A Canary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_canary#Miner.27s_canary)**

## Food Production
The general idea is to have an hydroponic greenhouse.
Feel free to start a discussion on details.

## Waste Management
Anaerobic Digester -> Aerobic Digester -> Suspended solids separation -> UV filter -> Lemna minor growing bed -> Particulate filter -> UV filter -> Activated Carbon filter -> Reverse Osmosis filter -> Pristine water :)

## Power Management
Solar, bateries, stuff running on low votage DC...
